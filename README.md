# Linux System Programming
This course contains 3 homeworks.
1. tree command
2. shell
3. editor

## tree
Write your own version of tree using system calls taught in the previous lectures. Add ANSI colors1 to identify the type of the file, i.e., color directories, executables, and links.

```
> cd tree
> make
```
## shell
Consider the shell that you are using in linux systems (or in windows, the command prompt). It contains many aspects of system programming concepts. Following the milestones below, please write your own shell to replace the /bin/bash or /bin/tcsh or whatever shell you are using.
```
> cd shell
> make
```
## editor
```
> cd editor
> make
```
